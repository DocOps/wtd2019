// tag::dependency-software[]
dependency, software::
A separate software product that is required for the development or operation of another application.

// end::dry[]

// tag::dynamism-in-cmses[]
dynamism (in CMSes)::
At a minimum, a content management system is _dynamic_ if it enables the setting of variables for tokenized substitution inside parsed content.
That is, users can embed references to outside data or content inside preprocessed source, which will be populated by that outside data or content, depending on which external content is established as the _value_ of any given _key_ (token).
Other elements of dynamism may include conditional processing, which is often necessary for the proper establishment and processing of variables.

// end::dynamism-in-cmses[]

// end::framework[]

// end::literal-expression[]

// tag::markdown[]
Markdown::
One of the lightest weight and most popular textual markup languages, popularized on GitHub, StackOverflow, various forums and comments systems, and numerous other places.

Thorough integration testing ensures all still-supported features and functionality remain backward compatible.

// end::regression-testing[]

// tag::relational-database[]
relational database::
A complex, multi-table data source that is structured according to a defined schema and primarily accessed using queries.
As opposed to flat files, RDBs are almost always stored as binary files and therefore opaque to most source control systems.

REST API::
An API (see <<glossary-api,API>>) that listens for and responds to HTTP requests to established endpoints.
A “RESTful” service waits for an HTTP client request, such as a _POST_, _GET_, or _DELETE_ transaction at a specific URI, enabling third-party developers to build applications to interact with that service based on documented functionality and permissable formats for exchanging data.
(REST stands for “Representational State Transfer”, which I had long-since forgotten before I just looked it up, because it is never used.)
